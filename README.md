# Stationary
This is technically the Stationary 2 as the original one was made by me (Jake Sales) and Calvin Hunter. 

Here is where you can play the original Stationary: https://gd.games/jakesales/stationary-gi9

# Purpose
The purpose of this game is to remake the game and create more content into the game that we originally couldn't with the limited GDevelop game engine.
Unity gives us more freedom to create more unique ideas and have actual code that is structured in a way I am comfortable with.

As of now, this project is on hold as I feel that there needs more direction and thought into where this game should be.
